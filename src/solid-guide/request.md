# Request # {#request}

## Authentication and Authorization ## {#auth}

[PROTOCOL] does not require the use of a specific authentication and authorization mechanism. Implementations are encouraged to use existing approaches, such as those described in the Solid Protocol sections on [[SOLID-PROTOCOL#authentication|Authentication]] and [[SOLID-PROTOCOL#authorization|Authorization]] [[SOLID-PROTOCOL]].
